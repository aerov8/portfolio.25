# Building Scalable Systems: Lessons from Pharmaceutical Workflows

Working at iA Pharmacy Fulfillment has given me unique insights into building systems that process millions of prescriptions daily. When you're dealing with healthcare, the stakes are high—errors can affect people's lives, and downtime means medications don't reach patients who need them.

## The Challenge of Scale

Pharmaceutical fulfillment systems face unique challenges that many software systems don't encounter. Processing thousands of prescriptions per hour across multiple clients requires careful architectural planning. Each prescription flows through a complex workflow—from order submission to final shipment—and every step must be tracked, verified, and auditable.

The system needs to maintain zero tolerance for errors while handling diverse client requirements. Different pharmacy chains like Publix have their own specific workflows and business rules that must be accommodated without compromising the core system's reliability.

## Architectural Foundations

### Event-Driven Design

One of the most critical decisions was adopting an event-driven architecture. Every state change in a prescription's lifecycle generates an event that other services can react to. This approach provides several key benefits.

First, it decouples services from each other. The order processing service doesn't need to know about inventory management details—it simply publishes an event, and interested services subscribe and react accordingly. This separation of concerns makes the system more maintainable and allows teams to work independently.

Second, event-driven architecture creates an automatic audit trail. Every action in the system is recorded as an event with a timestamp and relevant metadata. When investigating issues or generating compliance reports, we have a complete history of what happened and when.

Third, it enables independent scaling. If one part of the system becomes a bottleneck, we can scale just that component without affecting others. During peak hours, we might need more workers processing prescription verification events, but the order intake service might be running fine with its current capacity.

### Database Design for Performance

Working with SQL Server taught me that proper database design is crucial for systems handling millions of records. The prescription tracking system uses strategic indexing and table partitioning to maintain query performance even as data volumes grow.

Compound indexes on frequently queried columns dramatically improved our most common access patterns. When pharmacy staff search for prescriptions by status and creation date, the database can quickly locate relevant records without scanning millions of rows.

Table partitioning based on creation date keeps recent data—what people actually query most—in hot partitions that stay in memory. Older prescriptions naturally partition into less frequently accessed storage, optimizing both performance and cost.

### Comprehensive Testing Strategy

In healthcare software, testing isn't optional—it's critical. Our testing pyramid ensures quality at every level.

Unit tests verify that individual components behave correctly in isolation. Every service, every data transformation, every business rule has corresponding tests that run in seconds and catch regressions early.

Integration tests validate that services communicate correctly and handle database interactions properly. These tests use test databases that mirror production schemas, ensuring our code works with real-world data structures.

Regression testing before every deployment ensures that new features don't break existing functionality. We maintain extensive test suites that simulate real pharmacy workflows from end to end.

Patch validation against production-like data catches edge cases that might slip through other testing layers. Before any code reaches production, it processes sanitized copies of actual pharmacy data to ensure compatibility with real-world scenarios.

## Critical Lessons Learned

### Idempotency Prevents Chaos

In high-volume distributed systems, operations will be retried. Network hiccups, timeouts, and service restarts mean the same request might arrive multiple times. Making operations idempotent—safe to retry—saved us from countless issues.

When processing an order, the system first checks if it's already been processed. If so, it returns the previous result rather than creating duplicate work. This simple pattern prevents scenarios like double-charging patients or shipping duplicate medications.

### Observable Systems Are Maintainable Systems

We instrument every critical path in the application. Database query performance metrics help identify slow queries before they become problems. API response times reveal bottlenecks in external integrations. Queue depths show when one part of the system can't keep up with incoming work. Error rates broken down by type and client help us prioritize fixes.

This visibility has been invaluable for catching issues before they become critical. When a particular client's order volume spikes, we see the queue depth increase and can proactively scale resources. When a database query suddenly slows down, we investigate before users notice.

### Design for Inevitable Failure

Systems fail. Networks fail. Databases have hiccups. Designing with the assumption that failure will happen makes systems resilient.

Retry logic with exponential backoff handles transient failures gracefully. If a service call fails, we wait a bit and try again, backing off progressively to avoid overwhelming struggling services.

Circuit breakers protect against cascading failures. When an external service starts failing, we stop hammering it with requests and fail fast instead, giving it time to recover while preventing the problem from spreading.

Graceful degradation allows the system to continue functioning even when some components are unavailable. If the real-time inventory check service is down, we can still accept orders and verify inventory asynchronously.

### Documentation as Insurance

Workflow configurations are documented alongside their implementation. When training pharmacy staff at central-fill locations, having comprehensive documentation of how the system works—what validations occur, what each status means, how errors are handled—makes the difference between smooth go-lives and chaotic ones.

Clear documentation also helps new team members understand complex workflows quickly. When someone needs to modify a client-specific rule, they can read the documentation to understand the context and implications.

## Real-World Impact

The most rewarding part of working on these systems is knowing they help get medications to people who need them. When we optimize a workflow and reduce processing time by even a few minutes, that means patients get their prescriptions faster.

During go-live events at central-fill locations, we work directly with pharmacy staff, training them on our NEXiA software and troubleshooting issues in real-time. Seeing the system work smoothly in production, processing thousands of prescriptions without hiccups, makes all the careful engineering worthwhile.

There's something profound about building software where reliability directly impacts people's health. It raises the stakes but also gives the work deeper meaning.

## Looking Forward

Building scalable pharmaceutical systems reinforced several universal principles for high-volume, mission-critical software:

**Reliability trumps features**. A simple system that works 99.99% of the time is better than a feature-rich system that's flaky. Every feature decision should be weighed against its impact on system reliability.

**Observability is not optional**. You can't fix what you can't see. Comprehensive monitoring and logging are infrastructure, not nice-to-haves. They're what enables confident iteration and rapid incident response.

**Testing is an investment**. Every test you write pays dividends when refactoring or adding features. The time spent writing tests is always less than the time spent debugging production issues.

**Design for humans**. The people using your system—pharmacy staff, patients—should be at the center of every design decision. Technical elegance that creates user confusion is failure, not success.

These lessons apply far beyond pharmaceutical systems. They're relevant to any high-volume, mission-critical software where reliability and correctness matter more than anything else.
